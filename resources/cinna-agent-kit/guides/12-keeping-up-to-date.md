# 12 — Keeping the kit up to date

## Read this when

- The root `AGENTS.md` freshness rule fired (`.cinna-kit/.last_refresh_check` is
  missing or older than 7 days).
- A guide contradicts what you see, or references a file that does not exist.
- Before a cloud import, so the go-cloud playbook matches the platform.
- The user asks to "update the kit" or "refresh the conventions".

This is about the **kit**, not about the agents. Refreshing never touches anything
under `Local/`.

## Check

```bash
uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py refresh --check
```

It reads `.cinna-kit/VERSION`, compares it with `https://opencinna.io/api/agent-start/version`, reports
whether an update exists, and writes `.cinna-kit/.last_refresh_check`.

Offline or unreachable? It warns and exits 0. Say so in one line and continue with
the kit you have — a stale kit is fine; a blocked session is not.

**Two versions, two questions.** `VERSION` and `https://opencinna.io/api/agent-start/version` are the *kit*
content version: it moves with every guide, template and tool change, and it gates
nothing. `CONTRACT_VERSION` and `https://opencinna.io/api/agent-start/contract/version` are the *contract*
version — the semantic version in `kit.json`'s `contract_version` that every host agrees
on and that `kit.py validate` gates a folder against. `refresh --check` only ever asks
the first question; ask the second one directly when you need to know whether another
tool holding this contract (Cinna Desktop, for one) can still operate these folders.

## Update

```bash
uv run .cinna-kit/tools/kit.py refresh
```

It downloads the new tarball to a temporary directory, verifies it extracted
cleanly, and swaps `.cinna-kit/` in one move. The old tree is removed only after the
new one is in place, so an interrupted refresh leaves the previous kit working.

Then, always:

```bash
cat .cinna-kit/CHANGELOG.md      # top entry first
```

## Read the changelog properly

One file serves both purposes: `CHANGELOG.md` is the kit's changelog *and* the
contract's, and it ships in the contract tarball as well as the kit one — so Cinna
Desktop reads exactly these entries. Entries are headed by the **contract** version they
belong to, not by the kit version printed at the top of the file.

Within an entry, items are grouped in a fixed order:

1. **Breaking** — a convention that makes an existing agent invalid. Migrate now;
   the entry says how. A **major** bump of `contract_version` is always breaking; a
   minor bump is additive and safe to ignore. (`schema_version` is legacy: it is still
   parsed, but nothing gates on it any more.)
2. **Added** — new optional artefacts. Existing agents keep working untouched. Adopt
   only when the relevant ladder trigger has fired.
3. **Changed** — wording, defaults, reorganisation. No action.

Tell the user in one line what actually changed for them. "Kit updated" alone is not
useful; "Kit updated — schedules now need a timezone, I fixed both agents" is.

## What a refresh does and does not touch

| Touched | Not touched |
|---------|-------------|
| `.cinna-kit/` in full: guides, templates, schema, tools, `kit.json`, `layout.json`, `VERSION`, `CONTRACT_VERSION` | Anything under `Local/` |
| | Anything under `Cloud/` |
| | The root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore` |

New `templates/agent/` content applies to agents created **after** the refresh.
Existing agents are never rewritten automatically — and you should not rewrite them
by hand either unless a Breaking entry says to.

If a root file needs a change, the changelog says so explicitly; apply it yourself,
preserving anything the user added.

## Versions on an agent

Each agent folder records two of them in `cinna-agent.json`, and only one of them
decides anything.

`kit_version` is the kit the agent was scaffolded with. `kit.py validate` reports (at
info level) when it differs from the kit you are running — it is a content version, not
an ordered one, so "differs" is all either of us can say. That is information, not a
defect: an agent scaffolded by an older kit that validates cleanly is fine, and there is
no upgrade command.

`contract_version` is the gate. `validate` compares its **major** against the contract
this kit ships — `kit.json`'s `contract_version`, mirrored in the bare
`.cinna-kit/CONTRACT_VERSION` file:

| Folder vs. this kit | What `validate` does |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Same major | Nothing — it runs as-is, whatever the minor. |
| Folder's major **newer** | An error: refresh the kit before touching the folder. |
| Folder's major **older** | A warning: the folder is migratable — apply the Breaking entries for the gap. |
| `schema_version`, no `contract_version` and no `id` | A warning: a pre-1.0.0 folder. Read it, then re-stamp it. |
| No `contract_version` in anything else | An error: it is required of every folder that is not that legacy shape. |

That is the contract's own rule, not this tool's — the same table is in `CHANGELOG.md`
under "Compatibility", and Cinna Desktop applies it to the same folders. Migrate only
what a Breaking entry requires.

## After a refresh

1. Read the top changelog entry.
2. If it contains a Breaking item, run `kit.py validate` on **every** agent under
   `Local/` and fix what it flags.
3. Re-read any guide the changelog says changed, before acting on it from memory.
4. Report one line to the user.

## When the kit and reality disagree

If a guide describes something that does not match what you observe — a CLI verb
that does not exist, a field the platform rejects — trust the observed behaviour,
tell the user which guide is out of date, and refresh the kit before assuming
anything else in that guide is current. Do not silently work around it and leave the
next session to rediscover the same gap.

## Done when

- `.cinna-kit/.last_refresh_check` exists and is less than 7 days old.
- `.cinna-kit/VERSION` matches `https://opencinna.io/api/agent-start/version`, or you have told the user
  why it cannot be checked right now.
- You have read the top entry of `.cinna-kit/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Every Breaking item in that entry has been applied, or explicitly declined by the
  user.
- `kit.py validate` passes for every agent under `Local/`.
- The user knows in one sentence what changed for them.
