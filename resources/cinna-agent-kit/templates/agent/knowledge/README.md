# Knowledge — {{NAME}}

Static reference material this agent needs in order to be correct: business rules,
how an external system actually behaves, terminology, decision rationale. Read-only
at runtime, both locally and in the cloud.

Create one file (or one folder) per topic and reference it from
`docs/WORKFLOW_PROMPT.md` so the agent knows where to look:

```
knowledge/
├── invoice_matching_rules.md
└── vendor_portal/
    ├── api_quirks.md
    └── field_mapping.md
```

Do not put here:

- prompts (`docs/`), capabilities (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), tunable parameters
  (`config/`), lookup tables the scripts load (`files/`), or anything the agent
  produces at runtime (`app-data/storage/`);
- credentials, hostnames with tokens in them, or personal data.

Add this folder only when the ladder's **Knowledge & local skills** trigger has
fired; for *this* folder that means three or more distinct capabilities, or domain
documentation longer than a page. The rung's full trigger is in the ladder
(`.cinna-kit/README.md`); the guide is
`.cinna-kit/guides/08-knowledge-and-local-skills.md`.
